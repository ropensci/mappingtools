This task view contains information about mapping and visualizing
spatial data in R. The base version of R does not ship with many tools
for mapping spatial data. Thankfully, there are an increasingly large
number of tools for doing so, both with just R or javascript libraries.
A list of available packages and functions is presented below, grouped
by the type of activity. If you have any comments or suggestions for
additions or improvements for this taskview, go to Github and [submit an
issue](https://github.com/ropensci/maptools/issues), or [make some
changes](https://github.com/ropensci/maptools/CONTRIBUTING.md) and
[submit a pull request](https://github.com/ropensci/maptools/pulls). If
you can't contribute on Github, [send Jeff an
email](mailto:hollister.jeff@epa.gov). If you have an issue with one of
the packages discussed below, please contact the maintainer of that
package. This task view is focused on mapping spatial data and less so
on the foundations of working with spatial data in R. That material is
covered in detail in the [Spatial Task
View](Spatial%20Task%20View.html). There is some overlap between the two
task views, but an effort has been made to reduce redundancy so that
these task views compliment one another.

### Projecting Data

Coordinates for spatial data can come in many different flavors with
different units, datum, projections, and more. Many of the tools will
visualize your data regardless of the native coordinate reference
system; however, most (all?) of the javascript libraries assume some
flavor of latitude-longitude, thus if your data are projected they need
to be transformed back to geographic coordinates prior to mapping. For
most mapping and visualization efforts unprojected data (often displayed
in Web Mercator/EPSG::3857) is fine; however, if accurate area, length,
or distance measurements are required through interacting with the map,
then projections need to be considered. A discussion of projections and
coordinate systems is beyond the scope of this task view. To learn more
a good starting place is [NCEAS' Overview of Coordinate Reference
Systems in
R](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/\~frazier/RSpatialGuides/OverviewCoordinateReferenceSystems.pdf).
This more general discussion of projection from the
[USGS](http://egsc.usgs.gov/isb//pubs/MapProjections/projections.html)
is also good.

Once you know that you need to transform you data there are several
options:

-   [sp](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sp/index.html): The
    function `spTransform` (and methods in
    [rgdal](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rgdal/index.html)) is
    the workhorse function for spatial transformations of vector data
    and it uses [PROJ.4](http://trac.osgeo.org/proj/) arguments to
    specify the transformations. Accepted inputs are provided by the
    spTransform methods in
    [rgdal](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rgdal/index.html).
    [Source for `sp` on
    Github](https://github.com/edzer/sp/). [Source
    for `rgdal` on
    R-Forge](https://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/rgdal/).
-   [mapproj](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mapproj/index.html):
    This package provides a function to convert two vectors representing
    longitude (x) and latitude (y) to projected coordinates.
-   [PBSmapping](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/PBSmapping/index.html):
    The function `convUL` will transform coordinates between Universal
    Transverse Mercator (UTM) and longitude-latitude. A data frame with
    a `projection` attribute is required input. [Source on Google
    Code](http://code.google.com/p/pbs-software/)

### Geocoding

Geocoding is the process of converting address or place name information
into geographic coordinates. Most of these have somewhat restricted
Terms of Service(TOS). Be sure to read those carefully prior to use.
Links for the TOS are provided.

-   [geocodeHERE](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/geocodeHERE/index.html):

    API](https://developer.here.com/geocoder). [Source on

    The function `geocode` in
    [ggmap](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggmap/index.html)
    uses the [Google Geocoding
    API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/?csw=1).

-   [rydn](https://github.com/trestletech/rydn): Client for the Yahoo!
    Developers Network [BOSS PlaceFinder
    API](https://developer.yahoo.com/boss/). [Source on

### Map Data

There are \*many\* possible sources and formats of data to use as base
layers, so this list will most certainly be incomplete. Details for
reading and writing most types of spatial data are already included in
the [Analysis of Spatial Data Task
View](Analysis%20of%20Spatial%20Data%20Task%20View.html), thus this list
will focus on additional sources or features not discussed in that task
view.

    Provides utility for working with geojson data in R. Includes
